    This is a forward pass network I have spent a lot of
    time working on from scratch. As of this month and
    year I consider this to be the best performing
    minimal network.

    no padding, no bias, grayscale input, 3x3 kernels, channels_last
    rows, cols, kernels
    y,x,k

    kernels:
    3,3,2
    3,3,4
    3,3,8

    input:   28x28x1
    conv:    3x3x2 > 26x26x2 : relu
    maxpool: 13x13
    conv:    3x3x4 > 11x11x4 : relu
    maxpool: 5x5
    conv:    3x3x8 > 3x3x8 : relu
    gap:     array(8)
    dense:   sigmoid output
