This uses DATASET_V5.

The best way to improve or expand upon this dataset is to enable sample capture and once you finish a few rounds go through the `/targets` directory created on your desktop and remove every well centered enemy head/bodies from the folder and place it into a directory of targets, all the files left behind will be of nontargets or non centered heads/bodies of enemies, copy these into your nontargets dir.

It's easier to seperate targets from nontargest than vice-versa because I find my human brain can identify targets faster than it can identify random nontarget images.

Also this process helps to reduce any missfire that exists in the bot, honing in on it's accuracy, because we are adding only samples of nontargets that it throught are targets.
