This is using [TBVGG3](https://github.com/TFNN/TBVGG3).

Original project by Jim C. Williams [here.](https://github.com/jcwml/CSGO-Trigger-Bot-2)

TBVGG3 is more performant than Keras2c coming in at 330 FPS; however, models trained with TBVGG3 are less accurate than models trained in Tensorflow Keras.

This is a CNN.
